Aggregating metadata from portals across Belgium

---

## Open Data Portals in Belgium

Various local, regional and federal portals ...
- powered by different software products 
- publishing metadata in different languages
- using different themes and keywords

---

## How it works

---

## In a nutshell

- Scrapers, harvesting metadata from portals 
- Enhancers, cleaning and transforming metadata |
- Upload tool, sends the metadata to Drupal |
- Drupal website data.gov.be |

---

## Why not CKAN ?

- We already have 100+ Drupal websites

---

## Why not reuse the EU ODP ?

- The code of the EU ODP wasn't available yet
- 

The data is sent to the ODP anyway

## DCAT-AP exchange
